## Installation

I'm a little bit spoiled with Functional Reactive Programming these days, thus the dependency to Bacon and Bacon.Jquery.

to test on browser make sure you have installed bower

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

And then You could fetch all deps using it

```bash
$ bower install
```

Run a simple web server and open in http://localhost:8000/

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
